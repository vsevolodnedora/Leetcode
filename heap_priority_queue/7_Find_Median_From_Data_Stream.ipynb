    "# 295. Find Median from Data Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.\n",
    "For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.\n",
    "Implement the MedianFinder class:\n",
    "\n",
    "MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.\n",
    "void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.\n",
    "double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n",

    "We need to design a data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stight-forward way is to mainin a list or array and add data to it in order and whenever an element is added, a new median is computed and stored. Adding a number than is O(n) operation.  \n",
    "And Get median operation is O(1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we speed O(n) operation. The way is to split the operation into two.  \n",
    "The way to solve it is to use _two_ array, and these arrays must be sorted and it is usefull to use _heap_. \n",
    "- Small heap\n",
    "- Large heap\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps should be of equal size or at least differ by one element. This balance must be maintained.  \n",
    "A _heap_ is a structure where adding/removing an element is O(log(n)) operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two heaps:\n",
    "- max heap \n",
    "- min heap\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a max in a mean heap is O(1) ( as it is the last element ). \n",
    "In the min heap fiding a min is also (1) element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to assign heap types as following: \n",
    "- Small heap - max heap\n",
    "- Large heap - min heap\n",
    "\n",
    "The first vlue is always added to the small heap. This is log(n) operation.  \n",
    "Then we check size. If size difference > 1 : we find max value in the 'max heap' and add it to 'min heap'. This is O(1) * O(log(n)) operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the median is still O(1) as poping value from a heap is O(1).  \n",
