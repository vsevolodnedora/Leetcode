    "Can we use a _greedy_ approach? Start with the biggest coin and see what we need to add. This will not work, as we might not even have a required value coin to complete the amount. Thus, we cannot be gready. \n",

    "Consdier a brute force solution with _DFS_ or _backtracking_ solution.  \n",
    "A _backtracking_ solution we build a _decision tree_ where at the root we have len(coins) number of branches. Than, after the split, we will have _remaining_ value for each tree.  \n",

    "__NOTE__: the branches in the tree are __repaeated__ for the same values of _remaining_. Thus, if we compute it once, we can just use the same value again. \n",

    "A True dynamic solution is a _Bottom Up_ solution, where we solve the problem in reverse. We start with 0 and check what is the minimum number of coins to sum to 0. Then, we add '1' and see what is the minimum number of coins to sum to 1. Same for '2' and it is the DP[2] = 1 + DP[1], so the _dynamic part is_ \n",
