    "Given a string, we need to return the longest palindrom. A palindrom is a string that reads the same back and forth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bruteforce solution is to check each substring in the string and check if it is a palindrome and return the longest one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity to check if it is a palindrom is O(n), where n is the length of a string, which is a linear scan.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To find all substrings in a string is O(n^2) time complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the _overall time complexity_ is O(n * n^2), which is O(n^3).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Clever way\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check if a string a palindrome by using a 'two pointer' approach. Or we can start at the middle and check at each iteration the characters at the sides.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This we can set a pointer that goes linearly, ant at each point we 'scan' left and right with two additional pointers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall time cimplexity of this approach is O(n^2).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an edge case where the string initially is _even_ and it has to be accounter for. "
