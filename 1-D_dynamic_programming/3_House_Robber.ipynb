    "\n",
    "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\n",

    "[neetcodevideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73r3KWiEvyk)\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force approach is to iterate over _all combinations_ of the houses. \n",
    "Consider an array [1,2,3,1] We can only take en element, if it is not adjacent to the previos one. So we start with the first one and build a decision tree. The tree, however _is not a binary tree_. We can pick any element. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Take the first element '1'. \n",
    "- Chose the maximum that can be gained from [3,1] (subproblem)\n",
    "    -> 1 -> 3 (better option - total 4)\n",

    "- Chose a different initial \n",

    "__Determine recurrance relationship__ to break down the _dynamic problems_.  \n",

    "## Top-Down DP approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the beginning. It is a base case.  \n",
    "We start by chosing to either rub arr[0] or arr[1]. The second iteration we chose arr[1] or arr[2]. \n",
    "At each point we chose the max form the previos two steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = [1, 2, 3, 1] # given cost for robbery \n",

    "__NOTE__ the space complexity can be O(1) if we store only the last two values instead of saving the values for the enitre array.  We only need to store the _last two maxis_\n"
