    "# 91. Decode Ways\n",

    "A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "'A' -> \"1\"\n",
    "'B' -> \"2\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "'Z' -> \"26\"\n",
    "To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, \"11106\" can be mapped into:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"AAJF\" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)\n",
    "\"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10 6)\n",
    "Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because \"06\" cannot be mapped into 'F' since \"6\" is different from \"06\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.\n",

    "__NOTE__: the complexity here is the double digit values may either reference _two_ chars or _one_ char.  \n",
    "Thus, at each time we ncounter two numbers we can split a _dicision tree_. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a string like -06- would only map to one char.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the __brute force solution__. Consider a string 121. This can be decoded as follos (two options)\n",
    "start -> 1 char1 (for 1-9 numbers we can do it)\n",
    "        -> 21 char11 (as 21 < 26 and there is still a char in dict for it)\n",
    "      -> 12  char2 (for number 0 or > 9)\n",
    "        -> 1 char1 again\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: we can start either with one numer or with two numbers if they are < 26 and do not have a leading 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In code we can consider two digit, the first digid must be 1 or 2 and the second must be < 6 if 2 and <= 9 if 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Building this decision tree is not numerically efficient. The time cmplexity is O(n) for the tree the hight n.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### More efficient solution \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: there is a repeated work here, as we always make a split, each time we move though the initial number. A pointer will move through the number and point at a _sub problem_ of two numbers. For example, for 121, the subproblem is to consider 1 or 21 as a starting point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will employ `chasing` to store the solved problem.  \n",
    "The time complexity of making a binary decision is O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n), while the space complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this problem can also be solved with _O(1) in memory_, if we notice that we need to keep track on only two variables (similar to the house robber problem)\n",
