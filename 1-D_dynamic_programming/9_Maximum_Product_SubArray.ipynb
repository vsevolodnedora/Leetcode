    "The brute force solution is to go with two pointers, left and right, and scroll through all the elements. The time complexity is then O(n^2). \n",

    "There is a faster solution, a pattern that we can exploit.  \n",
    "If all elements are positive, the result increases as we add more elements. \n",

    "If numbers are all negative, it is more complicated. Here the result is changing depending on whether it is an _odd_ or an _even_ number of elements. \n",
    "Consequetive negative numbers give alternating sign.  \n",
    "If the consequtive numbers are the same sign, however, the result is positive (for two numbers).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A subproblem here is multiplying tho numbers. Identify the maximum and _minimum_ product of a subarray. This allows to account for the negative values. At the next iteration we just multiply the result with the next value and get both maximum and minium from that. Each time we update the _min_ and _max_. \n",
