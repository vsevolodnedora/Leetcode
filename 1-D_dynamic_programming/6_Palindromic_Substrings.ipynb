    "# 647. Palindromic Substrings\n",

    "Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.\n",

    "A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n",

    "This is from __Blind75__ list, and it is similar to _longest palindromic substring_ problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: palindromic strings may be either _odd_ or _even_ size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bruteforce solution, O(n^3) solution is as follows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to go through each substring, as we have a pointer that moves through the aray, the beginning, and another for the end of the substring, and at each iteration, we check if the _current_ substring is a palindrom. This check itself is O(n), and each of the pointers moving through the array is O(n), so the total solution is O(n^3).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more clever approach is, we go _in both directions_. This is done as follows. We have one pointer that traverses to the left and to the right from the current one. This allows us to compare one character at a time instead of checking the entire substring each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: with this apprach we only _get palindromes of odd length_. For the even length polindromes we need to _left and right ponters at adjacent positions_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall complexity of this apprach is O(n) for the expansion itself and O(n) for the total string scan, so the total time complexity is O(n^2)"
