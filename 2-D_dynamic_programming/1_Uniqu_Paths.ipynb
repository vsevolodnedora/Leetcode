    "There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n",

    "__NOTE__ this problem is similar to he recursive problem. However, notice, that once a decision is made on where to move, a part of the grid __mecomes unavaiable__.  \n",
    "At every turn we have 2 choices.  \n",
    "__NOTICE__ we can arrive to the same place via different paths. Thus, there is repeated work.  \n",
    "Thus, we can `hash` the path once we reach a position.  \n",
