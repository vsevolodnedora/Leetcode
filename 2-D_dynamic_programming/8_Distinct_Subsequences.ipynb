    "Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.\n",

    "Consider example of s = rabbbbit and rabbit; \n",
    "and how many subsequences of s can match s. We start with first character. It matches. We consder two ; the match; we conisder 3 they match; but when we consider 4 chars, we see a mismatch. Before we were incrementing both indeces corresponding these two strings. \n",
    "When there is a mismatch we need to increment the pointer of s i_s; to move as we need to match every character of string t.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We skip one char and move forward. Once we get a match, we increment both pointrs again. \n",
    "- If chars match -- two pointers ++\n",
    "- If chars mismatch -- only one char ++ (i_s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note. In case of repeating characters, we can skip it and use another char. Thus we may have several ways a substring can be matched. \n",
