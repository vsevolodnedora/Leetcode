    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.\n",

    "We need to count _combinations_; we have an infinite number of each coin.  \n",
    "We cannot re-use the same combination. Order does not matter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A brute-force solution, an exponential in time O(c^n), that can be reduced to O(m*n) with memoization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The brute-force solution is based on decision tree, that we build starting from the initial coin and adding coins as we go. In order to guarantee that we avoid repetitions, -- each time we make a decision we set a rule for next decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, going though branches of the tree from left to right we add criteria that we annot re-use the values that were _used in other branches_. This will give m^n solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a pointer t a coin that says that we cannot use coins to the left from it.  \n",
    "This is _memoization solution_ where we are _cashching_ repeated work. We will use _recursion_ and _DFS_ for tree traversal.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a 2D grid with _amount_ we need to achieve, from 0 to final value, and _coin_ value on the other.  \n",

    "5 .... ...          0  1 <- one coin available for choosong\n",
    "These values are computed using bottom-up approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For an arbitrary position we need to look to the right and below, which means \n",
    "that we need to fill the _entire_ grid in the memory. However, if we gow _row by row_ than we need to remember only two rows. The overall memory complexity is O(n). Meanwhile, for the entire table solution has complexity of O(m*n). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the memory-optimal solution is that we need to keep only the row below the current one that we need. \n"
