    "# 10. Regular Expression Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:\n",
    "\n",
    "'.' Matches any single character.​​​​\n",
    "'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reasoning\n",

    "[neetcodevideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAA8mgxlov8)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, s='aa' and p ='a' do not match  \n",
    "While s='aa' and p='a*' can match as * can be any mynber of 'a's; so True  \n",
    "Consider s='ab', p='.*'; here '.' is ''.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bruteforce solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a decision tree for s='aa' and p = 'a*'; \n",
    "We have a choice; either to repeat 'a' once, or 0 times. \n",
    "If we do not repeat the char, than the decision tree stops, as there are no other characters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we do repeat a for a '*' than we move down and now we have a choice whether to again repeat it once or not. If we do, we get 'aa' and it is what we need. So we recovered the solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree, however, is not very efficient, as we have to repeat making a decision 2^n times.  \n",
    "However, this is a DP problemt, i.e., there is repeated work that can be cahed.  \n",
    "We can do here a Top-Down DP with cahe and a Bottom-Up (within cache).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider a Top-Down DP solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consdier s='aab' and p='c*a*b*'.  \n",
    "Let's set two ponters for each string 'i' and 'j'.  \n",
    "How, if we see a '*' we have choices whether we repeat a character or not. \n",
    "__NOTE__ a '*' also means that there may be 0 characters. So, if we use '*' in the first position, we remove 'c' from the 'p' string. We also shift a pointer to 'a' now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we make a decision tree following 'nothing' branch and pointers became (i,j+2), \n",
    "whre +2 means that we also moved by a star.  \n",
    "Next we consider 'a*' and we make the choice, whether to add 1+ 'a' or just set 0 'a'.  \n",
    "We follow both braches. However, we know that we need 'a' so perhaps we can skip it here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following chosing 'a' with out '*' we now have 'ca' as a second string and pointers chaged to (i+1,j). Note, the 'j' is constant as we just removed star.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have a and '*' still so we can ether repeat 'a' again or just skip it and move to 'b'. \n",
    "If we add another 'a', so we get 'aa' -- this matches the string 'aab' (the first part). \n",
    "Indexes change as (i+1, j)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we again still have a star, and we can either use it or not. If we do, we get 'aaa' which is not what we need. So we chose not to use this '*' this time, so we get to 'aab'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we got a string 'aab' that is what we wanted to get.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if we are perfectly matched we check if both indeces got out of bounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, only one of the strings can go out of bounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If j is out of boudns we must return false.  "
