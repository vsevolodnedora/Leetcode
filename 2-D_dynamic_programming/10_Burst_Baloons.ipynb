    "You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.\n",

    "Hard problem. Dynamic program. Time O(n^3) and space complexity O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, here the complexity is in the cost of poping a baloon. It depends on the neighbours. Each time we pop a baloon, neighbours change.  \n",
    "Remember, boundaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a brute-force solution, where a build a decition tree, choosing what to burst at each time. At each layer we have n choices and the hight of the tree is n, so the come comexity of this solution is O(n^n) which is not efficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To imporve it we need to find subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we pop a baloon we can image a subproblem of whether we pop it or not, so we 2^n subsequences. This is not a correct subproblems. We need to have a simple subproblem, that cna be cached easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, each time we pop a baloon, we split the initial array into 2. Then there will be n^2 subarrays once we pop all of them. Thus, we can proceed. At each iteration we keep splitting the main array.  \n",
    "Note, subarrays are connected, so we need to keep this in mind.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do it more clever we need to pop arrays that _are not connected_. So, we set a splitting point for subarrays and pop values as far from the splitting point as pissble. \n",
    "\n",
    "A way to handle the onection is to add _implicit_ values at the boundary of real arrays.\n",
    "Thus, we need to figure which value to pop _last_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need 2D cache for left and right values as indexes that indicate the start and end of subarrays.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: (still brute force with cache)\n",
