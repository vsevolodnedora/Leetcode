    "329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix\n",

    "[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).\n",

    "Given an N*M matrix with intexers > 0 and we need to find length of an increasing path that is a longest. Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [\n",
    "    [9, 9, 4],\n",
    "    [6, 6, 8],\n",
    "    [2, 1, 1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where the path is the 1->2->6->9 (starting at the lower center).  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: we cannot reuse any values on a path as the path must be made of increasing values.  \n",
    "__Note__: once we found a path, each element there is a starting point of a longest path if we start from that point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Approaching solution:__  \n",
    "The _brute-force_ solution is to start at each poisiton and search for a longest path from this position and we record the result in a grid LIP. Then we find a maximum and return it.   \n",
    "To find a longest path from a given point we need to run a `DFS`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, we can `cash` the result of a DFS on each position, so once we enter this position again (starting from a different one) we can re-use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LIP matrix will look like \n",
    "```python\n",
    "LIP = [\n",
    "    [1, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [2, 2, 1], # - here we got 1 becase we saw that there is no other\n",
    "    [3, 4, 2] # this lower values are obtained using above values\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This solution may be efficient if we do not repeat the work my cashing the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The time and space complexity is O(n*m)"
