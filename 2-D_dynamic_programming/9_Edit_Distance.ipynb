    "Consider 2 pointers for two strings and consider them character by character. If chars are equal we increment both pointers. If they are not equal, we can use one of the three operations. Consider all three of them. If we _insert_a character, firtst pointer gets moved and a match is automatically accomplished as we insert the required char.\n",
